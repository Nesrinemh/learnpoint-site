    <span lang="en">Learnpoint has been updated with a new feature: <em>Import course content</em>. This feature is useful when you want to reuse content instead of recreating it from scratch.</span>
    <span lang="sv"></span>
</p>

<p>
    <span lang="en">You will find the feature at the bottom of the content page:</span>

<h2>
    <span lang="en">What can you import?</span>
    <span lang="sv"></span>
</h2>

<p>
    <span lang="en">You can import course items from Learnpoint courses. You can select specific items to import — or choose all of them. Note that it's only the content and attachments that will be imported, not the item settings.

<h2>
    <span lang="en">Import setting | Who can import content from a course?</span>
    <span lang="sv"></span>
</h2>

<p>
    <span lang="en">You can import content from all your own courses. But each course also has a setting that, when enabled, will allow every teacher in the school to import content from that course.</span>
    <span lang="sv"></span>
</p>

<p>
    <span lang="en">For existing courses, the setting has to be manually enabled, but when you create a new course, it will be enabled by default.</span>
