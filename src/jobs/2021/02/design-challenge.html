    <h1>Design Challenge</h1>

    <p>This design challenge is part of the application process for a designer position at Learnpoint. You will have recieved a mail if you're elected for this challenge.</p>

    <h2>Challenge Overview</h2>

    <p>Learnpoint is organized in courses and each course has a documents feature. Users can add, search, and view documents.</p>

    <p>The documents are sorted alphabetically, but there is no other structure. When there are lots of documents, it is difficult for the user to get a clear overview of all the documents.</p>

    <p>Note that the problem is not about finding a specific document. If the user knows the name of the document, she can search for it. The problem is about getting a clear overview when ther are lots of documents.</p>

    <p>Your task is to:
    <ol>
        <li>Find and discuss different solutions to this overview problem.</li>
        <li>Implement one of your solutions.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>How to approach the challange</h2>

    <p>Good design comes from a curiosity about problems, users, and trade-offs between different solutions. This design challenge is primarily about showcasing your thought processess and the way you approach a design problem. Make sure to spend enough time on the first task before moving on to the next. When your work is evaluated, the first task will be more important than the second.</p>

    <p>The second task should not be a finished implementation that's ready for deployment. It should rather be a proof-of-concept. If your chosen solution takes too much time to implement, you should limit your work by implementing only a part of the solution. To get started, you can download the source code of <a href="design-challenge-code.html" target="_blank">this simplified code example</a>.</p>

    <h2>Handing in your work</h2>

    <p>The first task should be documented in a pdf and the second task should be coded in a HTML file. The files should be zipped before handing them in.</p>

    <p>If you prefer, you can alternatively write a blog post for the first task and/or publish the second task on the web. If you choose this option, you should hand in links instead of zipped files.</p>

    <p>Hand in your work no later than March 15th to <strong><a href="mailto:karl.west@viaecole.se">karl.west@viaecole.se</a></strong></p>
