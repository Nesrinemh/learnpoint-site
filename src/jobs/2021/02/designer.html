        <span lang="en">Learnpoint is an integrated LMS and SIS made for teachers, students, administrators, and schools. The Learnpoint team is on a mission to simplify education and we're now hiring a full time designer.</span>

        <span lang="en">About the Job</span>
        <span lang="sv">Om tjänsten</span> 

    </h2>

    <p>
        <span lang="en">Design is often split into many different roles such as UI, UX, frontend developement, and so on. At Learnpoint, it's all one role. We believe the best designs come from someone who is involved at every step from idea and research to finished product.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span lang="en">This means that designers at Learnpoint are generalists. They are projects managers, visual designers, writers, researchers, developers, and more.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span lang="en">You'll spend most of your time designing the product Learnpoint. But occasionally you'll be working on other products, tools, and sites that's part of the company.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span lang="en">The day-to-day work varies a lot. During our six week work cycles, we mainly focus on designing and building new features. But as a designer, you'll also be working on bug fixes, adjustments, and minor improvements. Between each development cycle, we spend two weeks doing free research. You can read, design games, take a course, or anything else that will advance your design mastery.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span lang="en">The team don't share an office, so everyone works remotely. You can work from home, rent an office, or whatever works best for you. Where, when, and how you work is up to you.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span lang="en">Making a career at Learnpoint does not mean giving up on your craft. As you become better at design, you'll advance from junior designer to designer, and then from senior designer to lead designer, and so on. There are five levels of design mastery in total.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span lang="en">The salary for a junior designer is 31416 SEK.</span>
    </p>

    <h2>
        <span lang="en">About You</span>
        <span lang="sv">Om dig</span>
    </h2>

    <p>
        <span lang="en">You are truly interested in design, but perhaps even more interested in humans. How do humans think, how do they learn, what makes them happy? You understand that good design is as much about pixels, as it is about human perception, cognition, and culture.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span lang="en">You believe that design is about improving the life for others.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span lang="en">You are interested in results and answers, but even more interested in questions. You are curious to the bone and you love learning. You understand that there is no prescription for designing an easy-to-use feature, but you're eager to figure it out. You believe that nothing interesting starts with knowing. It starts with not knowing - it starts with a question.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span lang="en">You are proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And you love writing. You understand that words matters just as much as colors and spacing.</span>
    </p>
